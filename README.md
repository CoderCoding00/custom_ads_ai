PostGenAI 🤖

## The Challenge 🔐
Our user want to have a place to create a social media post automatically about the product that they sale in order to save their time. 


## The Concept 🔑
We want to create an application that client can use to generate a social media post for their business by using MERN Stack and use Bootstrap as a CSS. For the generate post, we're using OpenAI to fetch the data for our website. 

## User Story 📃

```
AS a user,
I WANT to have a post generator website for advertising product,
SO THAT I can have a post that I can copy and paste for my advertisement post about my product
```

## The Logic 🔍

```
GIVEN a post generator website,
WHEN I visit the site for the first time
THEN I am present with a home page with a start button
WHEN I click the button
THEN I will lead to a product description page 
WHEN I put my product description in 
THEN I can have a post relate to my product for me to copy and paste 
WHEN I click sign in on the navbar
THEN I can put my account information in 
WHEN I don't have an account
THEN I can sign up 
WHEN I want to log out
THEN I can click Log Out on the top right of the page and sign out 
```

## The Process 📝
To sastify our user's needs, we created: 
- Components for the home page, 
- Created schemas, routes, and models for the server side
- Created API route for OpenAI
- Apply CSS Bootstrap for pages
- Fixing error to make everything connect and work properly

Components

```
Created 7 files for components: 
Home, Nav, Signup, Login, Product-Description

```
